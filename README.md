# "On-Chain Credit Score" (Solidity & Vyper)

## Description
A blockchain-based credit scoring system for individuals without access to traditional financial institutions. This smart contract assigns credit scores based on repayment history, collateral, and community endorsements.

## Key Features
- Reputation-Based Lending: Users build credit history by making timely repayments.
- Decentralized Scoring: Uses smart contract logic to assign credit scores.
- Vyper & Solidity Hybrid: Core logic in Solidity, score calculations in Vyper for added security.
- NFT Credit Identity: Each user gets an NFT representing their credit profile.

## Why This Matters
Traditional credit systems often overlook Black and underbanked communities. This project demonstrates your understanding of DeFi, NFTs, and cross-contract execution between Solidity and Vyper.

## Tech Stack
- Solidity (Loan & Reputation Logic)
- Vyper (Credit Score Calculation)
- Chainlink oracles (for external data)
- Hardhat + Brownie (testing and deployment)
- ERC-721 (NFT-based identity)
